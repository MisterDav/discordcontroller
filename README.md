# discordcontroller
A Discord bot that controls your computer using commands. Original Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKb_xWW_EmU&amp;ab_channel=MisterDav

Change the token value with your own value so that you will be able to run this bot on your Discord server, and of course, your own computer. This was originally
written on Ubuntu Linux, so I have no idea if this works on Windows.

Use this at your own risk, you are responsible for your own damage for your own computer.
